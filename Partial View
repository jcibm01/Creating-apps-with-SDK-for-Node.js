IBM® Bluemix™ provides a SDK for Node.js starter application that you can use as a template. You can add your code to the starter application, and then push the changes back to Bluemix.
About the Node.js starter application

You can use the Node.js starter application to develop Node.js applications. The IBM SDK for Node.js runtime environment is the container for Node.js applications.

The Node.js starter application demonstrates how to develop and deploy a Node.js application for Bluemix.
Usage
Use the following steps to start using the Node.js starter application from the Bluemix user interface:

    Create a Node.js starter application and download the starter code.
        Click Create App to deploy a Node.js starter application.
        Provide the App name and Host in the prompt.
        After the application deploys, click the settings icon and click View Quick Start.
        Download the starter application package.
    Ensure that the cf command line tool is installed. This tool is a command line interface for application deployment and management on Bluemix. If you have not installed the cf command line tool, see Installing the cf tool.
    Log in to the Bluemix environment.

    $ cf login -a https://api.ng.bluemix.net -o <your org name> -s <your space name> API endpoint: https://api.ng.bluemix.net Warning: Insecure http API endpoint detected: secure https API endpoints are recommended Username> <your user ID> Password>******* Authenticating... OK Targeted org <your org name> Targeted space dev API endpoint: https://api.ng.bluemix.net (API version: 2.0.0) User: <your user ID> Org: <your org name> Space: <your space name>

    Add your code to the starter application, and then deploy the application again. You can use the readme file that is in the starter application package to see a description of each file that is in the package.

    Deploy your modified starter application to Bluemix by entering the cf push command. For example:

    $ cf push <yourappname> -p pathtoApp -m 512M

    Access your application. After your application is deployed to Bluemix, enter the URL of the application in a browser to see the application running.

    http://<yourappname>.mybluemix.net

    Optional: Bind services to your application. You can bind the services that are available in Bluemix to your application according to your requirements.

Deploying a Node.js application to Bluemix

You can deploy your Node.js application by using the IBM Node.js buildpack. The IBM Node.js buildpack stages your Node.js application to run in IBM Bluemix.

The buildpack reads the runtime and dependencies information that is defined in the package.json file of a Node.js application. The buildpack also packages the runtime and dependencies of your Node.js application into a droplet that can be deployed to the cloud.
Use the cf buildpacks command to check the status of the Node.js buildpacks that are provided by Bluemix.

$ cf buildpacks Getting buildpacks... buildpack position enabled locked filename ... nodejs_buildpack 8 true false buildpack_nodejs_v8-177-g2b0a5cf.zip sdk-for-nodejs 2 true false buildpack_sdk-for-nodejs_v1-20140613-1045.zip

sdk-for-nodejs is the default buildpack that is used for Node.js applications in Bluemix, and it is created by IBM. nodejs_buildpack is the external buildpack that is provided by the Cloud Foundry community. The sdk-for-nodejs takes precedence over the nodejs_buildpack in Bluemix. If you want to use the nodejs_buildpack with your application instead of the sdk-for-nodejs buildpack, you must specify your buildpack by using the -b option with the cf push command.
